In the workshop number which was the toughest for me, I learned a bit more about templates and how to use them as well as their syntax for implementation. In addition, I learned how to a template class variable, how the setting of a template class variable or member function to a particular type or processing of it is done, how to instantiate a class template, make derived template classes from different templated classes.

This workshop made me work with the templates which give me hard time writing code since the syntax for templates is big and confusing. Therefore, this workshop was a little bit of a struggle for me, however, I managed to do everything in a proper way as I think with the help of course notes and class lectures recordings.

The reason for including all the implementation in a header file was that if an implementation of all functions were outside of a header file, it would not be accessible by the compiler, and consequently would not be instantiated.

Also, “=initial” in the PairSummable(const K& key, const V& value = initial) function means the default value for the “value” variable is the value of “initial”.
